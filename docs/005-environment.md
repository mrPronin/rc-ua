# ENVIRONMENT

## DEVELOPMENT

For backend development, we will use local instances with Docker / docker-compose: API Server, PostgreSQL, Strapi (backend, client). For front-end development, we plan to prepare a mocked-api.

## STAGING

For the staging environment, we will use the CapRover platform and netcup.de as a hosting provider. This will allow us to test the platform and fill it with content.

## PRODUCTION

For production, we plan to use one of the leading cloud providers: GCP, AWS, or Azure. The final decision must be agreed upon by the team and the project donor.
